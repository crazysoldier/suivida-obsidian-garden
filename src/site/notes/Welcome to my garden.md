## Welcome to my garden

Unlike a blog, this digital garden is a collection of evolving ideas, not finished posts. Some notes are seedlings, just planted. Others are growing steadily. A few have matured into evergreen notes.

Feel free to wander, explore connections between ideas, and watch thoughts evolve over time. Each note shows when it was planted and last tended to.
